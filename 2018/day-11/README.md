Note:

- Part 2 was too slow to solve in a brute-force way in python.
- `day11-02.c` will take couple minutes, but is still brute-force.
- `day11-02-fast.py` uses [Summed-area table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summed-area_table) and gets the solution in couple seconds
- `day11-02-fast.c` is the C version, gets the solution in milliseconds.
